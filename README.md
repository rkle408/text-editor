# text-editor

Our PWA text editor will allow you to write code with COLORS, and save for if you need to return later -- WITHOUT hitting a save button! Hit the install button so you don't have to visit our website anymore, just open the application directly from your Desktop!

During this build, I learned that details are always, always important! Though there are multiple ways to do one action, make sure that the code doesn't interfere with another code. I also learned that when storing data and wanting to start over, you must clear your cache/history.
